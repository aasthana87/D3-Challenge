          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h2>
          <br>
          <p>There appears to be a relatively strong correlation between the percentage of individuals living in poverty and the percentage of 
            individuals who do not have health insurance across the United States. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to expect
            that states with a higher percentage of residents living in poverty will have a higher percentage of residents without health insurance.  
          </p>

          <p>New Hampshire appears to be an interesting outlier from this observation in that despite the lowest percentage of residents
            living in poverty, a relatively average to high proportion are without health insurance. 
          </p>

          <p>Based on this distribution, the state with the lowest proportion of residents living in poverty and without health insurance is Massachusetss,
            while the state with the highest proportion of residents living in poverty and without health insurance is Mississippi. Texas
            has the highest proportion of residents without health insurance. </p>
